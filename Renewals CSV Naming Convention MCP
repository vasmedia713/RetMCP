# Master Context Protocol (MCP) Document

## Title:
Renewals CSV Naming Convention MCP

---

### 1. Purpose
To establish a standardized naming convention for renewal CSV files when the **Renewal flag is checked**, ensuring consistency, clarity, and ease of identification across systems and teams.

---

### 2. Scope
- Applies **only to Renewals** where the Renewal flag is set to `true`.  
- Enrollment logic is **out of scope for MVP** and will be defined later.

---

### 3. Protocol Definition
**File Naming Format:**  
```
STATE RM Renewal COMPANY NAME [and COMPANY NAME ...] mm_dd_yy.csv
```

---

### 4. Components
- **STATE:** Two-letter state abbreviation (e.g., TX).  
- **Billing System:** Always `RM`.  
- **Transaction Type:** Always `Renewal` (only if Renewal flag is checked).  
- **Company Name(s):**  
  - Single premise: One company name.  
  - Multi-premise: Multiple company names separated by `and`.  
- **Date:** Format `mm_dd_yy`.  
- **Extension:** `.csv`.

---

### 5. Examples
- **Single Premise Renewal:**  
```
TX RM Renewal Jose's Pepper Company 01_07_25.csv
```

- **Multi-Premise Renewal:**  
```
TX RM Renewal Jose's Pepper Company and Stacys Donuts and Ashwith's Comfy Pillow 01_07_25.csv
```

---

### 6. Compliance
- All renewal CSV files must follow this naming convention before submission or upload.
- Files not adhering to this protocol will be rejected and require renaming.

---

### 7. Exceptions
- Enrollment transactions are excluded until logic is defined in future phases.
